To those who go in bliss, the dharmakāya they possess, and all their heirs, To all those worthy of respect, I reverently bow. I shall now in brief describe The practice of the heirs of those who go in bliss, according to the scriptures.
Here I shall say nothing that has not been said before, And in the art of prosody I have no skill. I therefore have no thought that this might be of benefit to others; I wrote it only to habituate my mind.
My faith will thus be strengthened for a little while, That I might grow accustomed to this virtuous way. But others who now chance upon my words May profit also, equal to myself in fortune.
So hard to find the ease and wealth whereby the aims of beings may be gained. If now I fail to turn it to my profit, how could such a chance be mine again?
For many aeons deeply pondering, The mighty Sages saw its benefits, Whereby unnumbered multitudes Are brought with ease to supreme joy.
Wishing to destroy the hundred sufferings of existence, desiring to remove the unhappiness of sentient beings, and wishing to experience hundreds of joys, one should never abandon bodhichitta.
When bodhichitta is born, in an instant, those wretched beings bound in the prison of samsara are called children of the Sugatas and become worthy of reverence by the gods and humans of the world.
Like the supreme form of the alchemical elixir, it transforms this impure body into the body of a victor, a priceless jewel. Therefore, firmly hold onto what is called bodhichitta.
The sole captain of beings, with immeasurable wisdom, when thoroughly examined, is precious. Those who wish to be free from the realm of beings, firmly hold the precious bodhichitta.
All other virtues, like water trees, produce their fruits and are exhausted. The tree of bodhichitta, however, constantly bears fruit and grows inexhaustibly.
Even if one has committed unbearable misdeeds, by relying on courage, as if facing great fear, that which can instantly liberate when relied upon - why do the cautious ones not rely on it?
To summarize, the bodhicitta should be understood as twofold: the mind aspiring to enlightenment and the mind entering into enlightenment.
Just as one understands the difference between wishing to go and actually going, likewise the wise should understand the distinction between these two in sequence.
From the aspiring mind of enlightenment, great results arise while in samsara. However, unlike the engaging mind, it does not produce a continuous stream of merit.
From the moment one genuinely adopts this irreversible mind, for the sake of liberating the infinite realms of sentient beings,
From now on, even when asleep or careless, the force of merit will continuously arise in great abundance, equal to the sky.
This was reasonably requested by Subāhu. For the sake of beings of lesser inclination, the Tathāgata himself taught this.
Even if one merely thinks of removing the headaches of sentient beings, that person with the intention to help obtains immeasurable merit.
What need is there to speak of those who long to remove the immeasurable sufferings of each and every sentient being, and wish to accomplish immeasurable qualities for each of them?
Who, be it father or mother, has such a benevolent mind? Do even gods, sages, or Brahma possess this?
These beings have never before, even in dreams, conceived such an attitude for their own sake. How then could it arise for the sake of others?
To them in whom this precious jewel of mind Is born—to them I bow!
The source of joy for all beings, the nectar that overcomes the suffering of sentient beings, how can one measure the merit of this precious mind?
Even by merely thinking of benefiting others, one surpasses the merit of worshipping the Buddha. What need is there to mention striving for the welfare of all sentient beings without exception?
Though wishing to be free from suffering, they run towards suffering itself. Though desiring happiness, in their ignorance they destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy.
For those who are deprived of happiness and endure much suffering, may they be satisfied with all happiness and may all their suffering be eliminated.
Where is there virtue equal to this, which dispels ignorance? Where is there such a friend? Where is there such merit?
For countless sentient beings, for a long time, the unsurpassed bliss of the Sugatas fulfills all wishes in the mind. What need is there to mention constant giving?
Whoever harbors ill will towards such a bodhisattva benefactor, for as many eons as the number of times they generated ill will, they will dwell in hell, thus spoke the Sage.
However, if one generates sincere faith, the fruits of that will increase even more. For the bodhisattvas, even in times of great urgency, no negativity arises and virtue naturally increases.
I prostrate to the body of the one in whom the precious supreme mind has arisen. I take refuge in the source of happiness, which brings joy even when harmed.
To hold fast to this precious mind, I make excellent offerings to the Tathagatas, the holy Dharma, the stainless Three Jewels, the sons of the Buddha, and these oceans of good qualities.
Precious mountains, and likewise, secluded and pleasant forest areas, trees adorned with flowers, and trees with good fruits and bowing branches.
In the world of gods and others, there are fragrances, incense, wish-fulfilling trees, precious trees, spontaneously grown crops, and other ornaments worthy of offering.
If I make excellent offerings to the supreme Buddha and his sons, may the holy recipients of offerings, those of great compassion, look upon me with love and accept these offerings of mine.
I am without merit, a great pauper. I have no other wealth for offerings. Therefore, O Protector who considers the welfare of others, please accept this by your own power for my sake.
To the Victorious Ones and their heirs, I offer my entire body forever. Supreme Bodhisattvas, please accept me completely. With respect, I will become your servant.
Since I am completely embraced by you, I will benefit beings in the world without fear. I will thoroughly transcend past misdeeds, and will not commit other misdeeds in the future.
To the Tathagatas and their sons, I offer many precious vases filled with fragrant water, pleasing and well-prepared, along with songs and music, to bathe their bodies.
Their bodies are clothed in incomparable garments. Their bodies are wiped with clean, fragrant cloths. Then, they are offered excellently dyed robes of the finest, most fragrant quality.
To the supreme object of worship, the Mighty Sage, I offer pleasing mandara flowers, lotuses, utpalas, and all other fragrant flowers, as well as beautiful, delightful garlands.
I offer clouds of incense, pervaded by the captivating fragrance of supreme perfume. I also offer various foods and drinks, along with divine cakes.
I offer precious lamps of golden lotuses in full bloom. On the ground spread with fragrant incense, I scatter beautiful flower petals.
The immeasurable palace, filled with melodious praise and beauty, adorned with hanging jewels and pearls blazing with splendor, and those boundless ornaments of the sky, I offer to the compassionate one.
I shall always offer to the mighty sages beautiful precious parasols with golden handles, adorned with pleasing ornaments all around, of fine shape and lovely to behold.
May there also be clouds of offerings, Sweet and pleasing music and melodies, That satisfy and relieve the suffering of beings, Each abiding in its own place.
May a continuous rain of precious jewels, flowers, and the like fall uninterruptedly upon all the sacred Dharma, the stupas, and the images.
Just as Manjushri and others make offerings to the Victorious Ones, likewise I make offerings to the Tathagatas, the Protectors, along with their sons.
To all the Buddhas of the three times, along with the supreme Dharma and Sangha, I prostrate with as many bodies as there are atoms in all realms.
I pay homage to the foundations of bodhicitta and to the stupas. I pay homage to the abbots, teachers, and those of supreme discipline.
Until I reach the essence of enlightenment, I take refuge in the Buddhas. Likewise, I take refuge in the Dharma and in the assembly of Bodhisattvas.
To the perfectly enlightened Buddhas and bodhisattvas dwelling in all directions, those endowed with great compassion, I join my palms and pray:
From beginningless samsara, in this life or others, the sins I have unknowingly committed or caused others to commit,
The wrongs that I have done through body, speech, and mind, driven by afflictions, to the Three Jewels, parents, teachers, and others.
I, a sinner flawed by many faults, confess to the guides all the extremely unbearable misdeeds I have committed.
Before my sins are purified, I may die prematurely. Please protect me swiftly, so that I may surely be freed from this.
This unreliable lord of death does not wait for what is done or not done. Therefore, whether sick or healthy, all should not rely on the suddenness of life.
Not knowing that I must depart leaving everything behind, I have committed various sins for the sake of friends and foes.
Even in this lifetime, many friends and enemies have passed away. The unbearable sins committed for their sake remain before us.
Thus, not realizing that I am impermanent, I have committed many kinds of sins through ignorance, attachment, and anger.
Though I lie on my bed, surrounded by all my relatives and friends, the experience of my life ending will be undergone by me alone.
When seized by the messenger of death, what good are relatives? What good are friends? At that time, if merit alone can protect one, even that I have not cultivated.
Protector, I, being careless, did not realize such fears. For the sake of this impermanent life, I have committed many sins.
Seized by the terrifying messengers of death, with frightful appearances, and afflicted by great and fearsome illness, what need is there to mention their extreme misery?
Who will save me well from this great fear? With eyes wide open in panic, I search in all four directions for refuge.
Terrified by fear, I offer myself to Samantabhadra. I myself offer my body to Manjushri.
To the protector Avalokiteshvara, whose compassionate conduct is unerring, I cry out with a wretched voice. I, a sinner, beseech you for protection.
I take refuge in the Vajra-holder, seeing whom the messengers of Yama and other hostile forces flee in terror to the four directions.
In the past, I transgressed your command. Now, seeing great fear, I come to you for refuge. Please swiftly remove my fear.
If one must follow a doctor's words even when afraid of ordinary illness, what need is there to mention the constant affliction by the hundred diseases of desire and other faults?
That one thing can destroy all people living in the world. If no other medicine to cure them can be found anywhere,
Those who do not follow the instructions of the all-knowing physician who removes all pain are extremely foolish and worthy of contempt.
If one must be cautious even with a small ordinary precipice, what need is there to mention a long-lasting precipice that drops for a thousand leagues?
Who has given me fearlessness? How can I be certain to escape from this? If it is inevitable, how can my mind be at ease?
What more do I have left after experiencing and destroying what came before? I, being strongly attached to that, have acted contrary to the guru's instructions.
In this life and likewise, having abandoned relatives and friends, if one must go alone, what use are friends and enemies?
Due to my ignorance and delusion, I have committed various misdeeds, whether naturally wrong or prohibited by precept.
I beseech the guides to grasp my sins and faults. As this is not good, henceforth I will never do it again.
I rejoice with joy in the virtue that relieves the suffering of all beings' lower realms, and in the happiness of those who are suffering.
I rejoice in the accumulation of virtue that becomes the cause of enlightenment. I rejoice in the certain liberation of embodied beings from the sufferings of samsara.
I rejoice in the enlightenment of the protectors and in the grounds of the bodhisattvas. I joyfully rejoice in the ocean of virtuous bodhichitta that brings happiness to all beings, and in the beneficial deeds done for sentient beings.
To all the Buddhas in every direction, I join my palms and pray: For sentient beings confused in the darkness of suffering, Please kindle the lamp of Dharma.
When the Victorious One wishes to pass into nirvana, with palms joined in supplication, I beseech: Do not leave these beings in darkness, but remain for countless eons, I pray.
Having done all these things, by whatever virtue I have accumulated, may it remove all the sufferings of all sentient beings.
May I be the medicine, the physician, and the nurse for all sick beings until they are cured.
I shall cause a rain of food and drink to fall, removing the suffering of hunger and thirst. During the intermediate age of famine, I shall become food and drink.
For sentient beings who are poor and destitute, may I become an inexhaustible treasure. May I remain close at hand as various necessities and resources.
By giving up everything, one transcends sorrow. My mind achieves transcendence of sorrow. When giving up everything at once, giving to sentient beings is supreme.
I have already given this body freely to all beings. Let them always kill, revile, beat, or do whatever they please with it.
Whether they play with my body, or mock and ridicule me, I have already given this body away. What use is there in protecting it?
Let them do whatever work that does not harm it. May nothing ever be pointless when focused on me.
Those who speak ill of me, or cause me harm, or likewise mock me - may they all have the fortune of enlightenment.
I am the protector of those without protection, the guide for those on the path, and for those who wish to cross, I have become their boat, ship, and bridge.
The wish-fulfilling jewel and the excellent vase, accomplished mantras and great medicines, the wish-granting tree, and those that fulfill the desires of beings.
Like the earth and other great elements, and like space, may I always be the ground of life for the boundless multitude of beings.
Just as the Sugatas of the past Generated the mind of enlightenment, And progressively abided In the training of a bodhisattva,
Thus, those endowed with wisdom, having firmly grasped the awakening mind, in order to expand it further, should praise the mind in this way.
This is the supreme nectar that conquers the lord of death for beings. This is also the inexhaustible treasure that dispels the poverty of beings.
This is the supreme medicine that pacifies all the illnesses of beings. It is the tree of rest for beings who are weary from wandering the paths of existence.
It is the common platform that liberates all beings from lower realms. It is the rising moon of the mind that dispels the torment of beings' afflictions.
The great sun dispels the ignorance of beings. The essence of butter emerges from churning the milk of the holy Dharma.
For those wandering guests traveling the path of existence, desiring to experience the enjoyments of happiness, this abides as the supreme happiness, satisfying the great guests of sentient beings.
Today, in the presence of all protectors, I invite beings to buddhahood and, meanwhile, to happiness. Gods, demigods, and all others, rejoice!
Thus, the child of the Victorious Ones should firmly hold the awakening mind, and strive diligently without distraction to never transgress the trainings.
Whatever was hastily begun or not well considered, even if a commitment was made, it is proper to reconsider whether to do it or abandon it.
That which has been examined by the Buddhas and their children with great wisdom, and which I have also examined myself, what reason is there to delay in this?
If one earnestly invites supreme happiness, yet deceives all beings, how can one possibly attain a fortunate rebirth?
Those who liberate beings who have abandoned the mind of enlightenment, their methods are inconceivable. Only the omniscient one knows this.
For a bodhisattva, this is the heaviest among downfalls. If this occurs, it diminishes the benefit of all sentient beings.
Whoever, even for a moment, obstructs or hinders the merit of this, by failing in their duty to beings, their descent into lower realms will be endless.
If destroying even one being's happiness diminishes oneself, what need is there to speak of destroying the happiness of limitless beings that fill all of space?
Thus, when powerful downfalls and powerful bodhicitta alternate in samsara, it takes a long time to attain the grounds.
Therefore, as I have pledged, I will respectfully accomplish it. If I do not strive from now on, I will descend lower and lower.
Though countless Buddhas who benefit all beings have passed, due to my own faults, I have not become an object of their healing activity.
If I continue to act in this way, again and again it will be the same: I will experience lower rebirths, sickness, bondage, cutting, piercing, and so forth.
Even on such a day of health, with food and no harm, life is deceptive in an instant, and the body is like a temporary loan.
With such conduct as this, I will not even obtain a human body. If I do not obtain a human body, there will be only sin and no virtue.
When I have the fortune to practice virtue, if I do not perform virtuous deeds, what can I do when I am confused by the sufferings of the lower realms?
If one does not perform virtuous deeds and accumulates sins, even for a hundred billion eons, one will not hear even the sound of a good rebirth.
Even a single moment's negative action can lead to rebirth in the hell realms for an eon. So what need is there to mention that the negative actions accumulated since beginningless time in samsara will prevent one from attaining a fortunate rebirth?
Though they experience only that much, it does not lead to liberation. For even while experiencing that, other sins proliferate greatly.
Having found such leisure, if I do not practice virtue, there is no greater deception than this, no greater delusion than this.
If I understand this and yet through confusion still remain lazy, when the time of death comes, great sorrow will arise.
If my body is burned for a long time by the unbearable fires of hell, my mind will undoubtedly be tormented by the blazing fire of unbearable regret.
Like one bewildered by a spell, I have no mind here. By what am I confused? I do not know. What is there within me?
Enemies like anger and desire have no arms or legs, nor are they brave or wise. Yet somehow they have made me their slave.
To not be angry and to have patience even towards those who joyfully harm me while dwelling in my mind is patience in an improper situation and is worthy of criticism.
Even if all the gods and demigods rose up against me as enemies, they would not be able to lead me into the fires of the Avici hell.
This powerful enemy of afflictions, when encountered, can reduce even Mount Meru to dust in an instant, leaving nothing behind. There, I will be abandoned in a single moment.
My afflictive emotions, which are my enemies, seem to have no beginning or end. All other enemies are not like that; they cannot endure for long.
Thus, if this long-standing enemy, the sole cause of the increase of harm, certainly takes up residence in my heart, how can I be fearless and joyful in samsara?
Thus, until I have directly and certainly defeated this enemy, I will not abandon my efforts here. Those who become angry even at small harms, the proud ones, will not sleep until they have defeated it.
When even wounds inflicted by a meaningless enemy are worn like ornaments on the body, why should suffering harm me when I strive correctly for a great purpose?
When I vowed to liberate beings from afflictions in the ten directions to the ends of space, while I myself was not free from afflictions,
Not knowing my own measure, how is my speech not that of a madman? Thus, to destroy afflictions, I should always strive without turning back.
Take note of your defilements and your pointless efforts. For thus the heroes seize firmly on such faults with proper remedies.
I may be burned and killed, or even have my head cut off, but I will never bow down to the enemy of afflictions in any way.
Even if an ordinary enemy is expelled from the country, they may settle in another land, gather strength, and then return. The enemy of afflictions is not like that.
Abandon afflictions with the eye of wisdom. Where will they go when removed from my mind? Where will they dwell and return from to harm me? My mind's attachment to them has simply ceased.
Having reflected thus, as explained, one should strive to accomplish the training. If a patient does not listen to the doctor's words, how can they be cured by medicines?
Those who wish to guard their training should diligently guard their minds. If this mind is not guarded, it will be impossible to guard one's training.
The uncontrolled elephant of the mind causes harm like the torments of hell. An untamed, intoxicated elephant does not cause such harm here.
If you tightly bind the elephant of the mind with the rope of mindfulness, all fears will disappear and all virtues will come to hand.
Tigers, lions, elephants, bears, snakes, and all enemies, guardians of hell beings, witches, and likewise demons.
By taming this mind alone, all those will be tamed. By subduing this mind alone, all those will be subdued.
Thus, all fears and immeasurable sufferings arise from the mind, as taught by the perfect speech itself.
Who purposely created the weapons of hell beings? Who made the burning iron ground? Where did those masses of fire come from?
The Buddha taught that all such thoughts are sinful. Thus, in all three worlds, there is nothing more fearsome than the mind.
If giving away all to leave beings destitute is the perfection of generosity, how did the previous protectors perfect it when there were still poor beings?
The perfection of giving is taught as giving away all possessions with their fruits to all beings with a generous mind. Therefore, it is the mind itself.
Fish and others, wherever they are, should be driven away without killing them. From obtaining a mind of renunciation, it is said to be the perfection of moral discipline.
Unruly beings are as limitless as space; they cannot all be overcome. But if the mind of anger is defeated, all enemies will be defeated.
Even if one practices all recitations and austerities for a long time, when done with a distracted mind, the wise say it is meaningless.
Those who do not know this secret of the mind, the supreme essence of the Dharma, though they desire to attain happiness and overcome suffering, they wander aimlessly without purpose.
Therefore, this mind of mine should be well-guarded and well-protected. Apart from the discipline of guarding the mind, what is the use of many other disciplines?
When living among those with loose morals, be cautious as if tending to a wound. Likewise, when dwelling among wicked people, always guard this wound of the mind.
If one is frightened by the small suffering of a wound and takes care of the wound, why not protect against the fears of being crushed and destroyed, which are like wounds of the mind?
If one abides with such conduct, whether dwelling among evil people or among women, the steadfast practitioner's vows will not deteriorate.
It is better to lose my gains, honors, body, and livelihood, and even other virtues, but never let my mind deteriorate.
"To those who wish to guard their minds, I join my palms and say: ""Guard mindfulness and introspection with all your might."""
Those disturbed by illness are powerless in all actions. Likewise, those whose minds are disturbed by ignorance are powerless in all actions.
Those with minds lacking awareness, even their hearing, contemplation, and meditation, like water in a leaky vessel, do not remain in their memory.
Even those who are learned, faithful, and diligent, if they lack mindfulness and are attached to faults, they will become entangled in downfalls.
Those without mindfulness are like thieves. Following those with impaired memory, even though they accumulate merit, it is stolen away as if by thieves, and they go to lower realms.
These bands of affliction-thieves seek opportunities. When they find an opening, they steal virtue and destroy even the life of good rebirths.
Therefore, never let mindfulness stray from the door of your mind. Even if it goes, remember the harms of lower realms and bring it close again.
The Buddhas and bodhisattvas possess unobstructed vision everywhere. I am always in the presence of all of them.
When mindfulness remains at the gate of the mind for the purpose of protection, then introspection will come, and even that which has gone will return.
First, recognize that this kind of mind is flawed. Then, I should remain steadfast like a tree.
I shall never engage in pointless gazing. With mindful awareness, I shall always look with lowered eyes.
"To rest your eyes, occasionally look around in different directions. If someone appears in your line of sight, look at them and say, ""It's good that you've come."""
After examining front and back, go or come. Thus, in all circumstances, act with understanding of what is needed.
Thus, having completed the action of how to position the body, then at times one should observe how this body is positioned.
The intoxicated elephant of the mind should be firmly tethered to the great pillar of contemplating the Dharma. Strive with all effort to ensure it does not break free.
"From time to time, examine your mind in this way: ""Where is my mind engaged? Is it striving in concentration without losing even a single moment?"""
If unable to connect with fear and celebration and so on, do as you please. Thus, at times of giving, it is said to be indifferent to moral discipline.
When engaging in various idle talks and many wondrous spectacles, one should abandon attachment to them.
If you find yourself digging the earth, cutting grass, or drawing on the ground for no reason, remember the teachings of the Sugata and, out of fear, immediately abandon such actions.
When you wish to move or speak, first examine your own mind, and then act with mindfulness and awareness.
When one's mind is inclined to attachment and anger, one should not act or speak. One should remain still like a tree.
When I am inclined to praise myself or criticize others, or when I become abusive and regretful, at that time I should remain still like a tree.
If one desires gain, honor, and fame, or wishes to have attendants, or wants one's mind to be revered, at that time one should remain like a tree.
When the thought arises to abandon others' welfare, to pursue one's own interests, or to speak, one should remain still like a tree.
When impatience, laziness, fear, as well as recklessness, idle chatter, and attachment to one's own side arise, at that time one should remain like a tree.
Thus, having examined the mind afflicted by defilements and useless efforts, at that time the hero should firmly grasp the antidote.
With great certainty and deep devotion, steadfastness and respect, humility, modesty, and fear, being peaceful and striving to please others.
In reality, without fault, controlling myself and sentient beings, like an emanation without self, this mind should always be held.
After a long time, having obtained the supreme leisure, reflecting on this again and again, one should hold the mind unwaveringly, like Mount Meru.
Though vultures, attached to flesh, drag you here and there, if your mind does not become displeased, why do you now give advice?
Having grasped this body as your own, why do you, mind, protect it? You and it are separate, so what can it do for you?
O deluded mind, why do you not grasp the pure wooden form? What use is it to guard this rotten machine of impurities?
First, separate this layer of skin with your own mind. Then, separate the flesh from the network of bones with the weapon of wisdom.
"Separate the bones and examine them down to the feet. Ask yourself, ""What essence is there in this?"" Investigate it yourself."
Although you have searched diligently, if you have not seen its essence, why do you still protect this body with attachment?
You should not eat impure things. You should not drink blood. If you should not even examine intestines, what use is this body to you?
Foxes and vultures should guard this for food. This human body is merely to be used.
Though you protect it thus, when the merciless Lord of Death snatches it away and gives it to birds and dogs, what can you do then?
If a servant is unfit for work, yet you don't provide them with clothes and such, if this body moves and goes elsewhere, why do you exhaust yourself so?
Having given this one a reward, now let them do their own work. Without benefit, do not give everything to this one.
Think of the body as a boat, merely for coming and going. Transform it into a wish-fulfilling body to accomplish the benefit of sentient beings.
Thus, with self-control, always maintain a smiling face. Abandon frowns and scowls completely, and be an honest friend to all beings.
Do not carelessly throw chairs and such with noise. Do not open doors forcefully. Always be humble and joyful.
Like otters, cats, and thieves, who move silently and stealthily, the sage always practices in this way to accomplish their desired goals.
Praise virtues in private. When virtues are praised, repeat them. When praising one's own virtues, know that this is understood as knowing virtues.
All efforts are for the sake of joy. Even if bought with riches, it is rare. Therefore, through the virtues created by others, one should experience the happiness of joy.
When speaking, do so in a way that is pleasing and coherent, clear in meaning and agreeable, free from attachment and anger, gentle and measured.
"Even when looking at sentient beings with one's eyes, one should look at them with honesty and loving-kindness, thinking, ""Relying on these very beings, I will attain Buddhahood."""
Constantly aroused by attachment or by its antidote, virtuous and beneficial, great virtue arises in suffering.
With skill and enthusiasm, I shall always perform all tasks myself. I should not depend on anyone else for any task.
Practice the perfection of generosity and others, progressing from one level to the next. Do not give up the greater for the sake of the lesser. Think primarily of the welfare of others.
Thus understanding, one should always strive for the benefit of others. The compassionate ones, with their far-reaching vision, permit even what is forbidden for their sake.
The holy Dharma is the body of practice. Do not harm it for trivial reasons. If you act in this way, the wishes of sentient beings will be quickly fulfilled.
Without pure compassionate intention, one should not give up this body. Rather, it should be given as a cause for accomplishing great purpose here and elsewhere.
Do not teach the Dharma to those who are disrespectful. Not to those who, though not ill, have their heads wrapped, nor to those carrying umbrellas, sticks, or weapons, nor to those with covered heads.
Profound and vast, yet humble; not a woman without a man. Treat all dharmas, both lowly and supreme, with equal respect and practice them always.
Those who are vessels of the vast Dharma should not engage in inferior teachings. One should not completely abandon one's conduct. One should not be led astray by sutras and mantras.
When discarding tooth sticks and spittle, they should be covered. Discarding urine and such in water or on open ground is discouraged.
Do not eat with a full mouth, making noise, or with your mouth open. Do not sit with your legs stretched out. Do not rub your hands together.
Do not be alone with other women in vehicles, beds, or secluded places. Avoid all things that cause people to lose faith, whether seen or heard about.
Do not point with your finger. Everyone should respectfully use their right hand to show the way.
The hands should not be moved too much. Make a slight movement and produce a sound. Make signals such as snapping fingers. Otherwise, one will become unrestrained.
Like the Protector who passed into nirvana, one should lie down in the desired direction. With mindfulness, quickly arise with the thought to definitely apply oneself from the very beginning.
The practices of bodhisattvas are taught to be immeasurable. Among them, the practice of training the mind should certainly be engaged in for that duration.
Three times during day and night, recite the Three Heaps Sutra. By relying on the Victor and the bodhicitta mind, pacify the remainder of downfalls.
Whether under one's own power or that of another, whatever situation one is in, whatever one does, one should strive to practice what has been taught as training in that situation.
There is nothing that the bodhisattvas do not train in. For the wise who abide in this way, there is nothing that does not become merit.
Whether directly or indirectly, engage in nothing other than the welfare of beings. For the sake of beings alone, dedicate everything to enlightenment.
A spiritual friend who is always virtuous, skilled in the meaning of the Great Vehicle, and supreme in the discipline of bodhisattvas should not be abandoned even for the sake of one's life.
From the biography of Palchungwa, learn how to rely on a lama. This and other Buddha's teachings should be understood by reading the sutras.
The teachings appear in the sutras. Therefore, one should read the sutras. The Akashagarbha Sutra should be studied first.
Because it extensively teaches what is to be practiced constantly, the compendium of all trainings should be studied again and again with certainty.
Whatever is not prohibited, that itself should be practiced. In order to protect the minds of worldly beings, having seen the training, practice it correctly.
The state of body and mind should be examined again and again. This alone, in brief, is the characteristic of maintaining mindfulness.
These should be practiced with the body. What can be accomplished by mere words? Will merely reading medical treatises cure the sick?
There is no sin like hatred, and no austerity like patience. Therefore, one should diligently cultivate patience in various ways.
If one harbors anger and resentment, the mind will not experience peace. One will not attain joy and happiness, sleep will not come, and one will become unstable.
Those who have been given wealth and honor, and have relied on that kindness, even they will attack to kill that hateful master.
This will make friends weary. Even if attracted by generosity, they will not rely on you. In short, there is no one who dwells happily in anger.
The enemy of anger and the like cause suffering. One who diligently overcomes anger will be happy here and elsewhere.
When unwanted things are done and desired things are obstructed, finding the food of mental discomfort, anger grows and destroys oneself.
Therefore, I should utterly destroy the food of that enemy. For this enemy has no other task than to harm me.
Whatever happens, I will not disturb my joyful mind. Being displeased will not fulfill my desires. My virtues will only decline.
If it can be remedied, why be displeased about it? If it cannot be remedied, what use is there in being displeased about it?
For myself or my friends, I do not desire suffering, contempt, harsh words, or unpleasant speech. For enemies, it is the opposite of this.
The causes of happiness arise occasionally. The causes of suffering are very many. Without suffering, there is no definite liberation. Therefore, mind, resolve to be steadfast.
Why do you not see the pointless suffering caused by snakes, mosquitoes, hunger, thirst, itching, and other such sensations?
I will not be impatient with heat, cold, rain, wind, and the like, nor with sickness, bondage, beatings, and so forth. If I do so, the harm will increase.
Some, upon seeing their own blood, become even more courageous. Others, upon seeing the blood of others, become faint and lose consciousness.
Even when suffering arises, the wise do not disturb their minds. When battling afflictions, many harms occur during the fight.
Those who endure all sufferings and conquer enemies like anger are victorious heroes. The rest are killing corpses.
Furthermore, the qualities of suffering are: It removes arrogance through weariness, generates compassion for those in samsara, makes one cautious of wrongdoing and delights in virtue.
Why not be angry at great sources of suffering like bile and so on? Why be angry at those with minds? All of these are provoked by conditions.
For example, even though unwanted, this illness arises. Similarly, even though unwanted, afflictions forcefully arise.
All faults and various kinds of misdeeds arise from the power of conditions. They do not exist independently.
"That which is desired as the principal and that which is conceived as the self, thinking ""This self should arise,"" there is no arising despite deliberate intention."
If something does not come to be when something else is absent, And does arise, that factor being present, That factor is indeed its cause. That which is always distracted by objects Will not cease.
If the self were permanent, it would appear to be inactive like space. Even when encountering other conditions, what could be done to that which is unchanging?
"When acting, if it's just like before, what has the action done to it? What connection is there to say, ""This is its action""?"
Thus, everything is under the control of others. Due to their control, one has no power. Understanding this, one will not become angry at all things, like a snake.
If one asks what should be prevented by what, and whether prevention is reasonable, it is not unreasonable to desire that sufferings be cut off by relying on that.
"Therefore, whether enemy or friend, if you see them doing something improper, think ""This happened due to such conditions,"" and in this way, remain at ease."
If things were achieved by one's own wish, since no one desires suffering, no embodied being would ever experience suffering.
Through carelessness, I harm even myself with thorns and such. For the sake of obtaining women and the like, I become greedy and engage in fasting and other practices.
Some choke and jump into precipices. By eating poison and incompatible foods, And by engaging in non-virtuous actions, They harm themselves.
When under the power of afflictions, they even kill their own beloved selves. How then could they refrain from harming others' bodies at such times?
If harming others is the nature of childish people, it is not right to be angry at them. It is like blaming fire for its nature of burning.
In the past, I have caused such harm to sentient beings. Therefore, it is fitting that this harm comes to me, who harms sentient beings.
His weapon and my body are both causes of suffering. He drew the weapon, I put forth the body. At which should I be angry?
When I, blinded by craving, grasp at a human-like form that is unbearable to touch and full of suffering, at whom should I be angry for the harm that results?
Children do not want suffering, yet they crave the causes of suffering. When harmed by their own faults, what reason is there to blame others?
For example, like the guardians of hell and the forest of sword-leaves, these are produced by one's own actions. At whom should one be angry?
If I have the virtue of intention, I will not go to hell. If I protect myself, what has happened to them here?
However, if I retaliate with harm, they will not be protected, my conduct will deteriorate, and thus my austerities will be destroyed.
The mind is not physical, so no one can destroy it anywhere. Due to strong attachment to the body, the body is harmed by sufferings.
When contempt, harsh words, and unpleasant speech do not harm the body, why, mind, do you become so angry?
Those who dislike me, if they do not harm me in this life or the next, why should I not desire them?
If I do not desire this because it hinders my attainments, I will abandon my gains here, while sins remain firmly.
It is better for me to die today than to live long through wrong livelihood. Even if I were to live long, it would still end in the suffering of death.
One who experiences happiness in a dream for a hundred years and then wakes up, and another who experiences happiness for just a moment and then wakes up.
Though one may gain many possessions and enjoy happiness for a long time, like something snatched by a thief, one goes naked and empty-handed.
If one survives by gain, should one exhaust negativities and accumulate merit? If one becomes angry for the sake of gain, won't merit be exhausted and negativities increase?
If the very purpose for which I live is lost, what use is such a life that only commits evil?
If you become angry when others speak harshly to you, why don't you become angry in the same way when you speak harshly to others?
If you can tolerate those without faith, as their lack of faith depends on others, why can't you tolerate unpleasant speech, as it depends on the arising of afflictions?
Even towards those who desecrate or destroy statues, stupas, or holy scriptures, it is not right for me to feel anger. The Buddhas and others cannot be harmed.
Seeing that those who harm our teachers, relatives, and friends are also subject to change due to previous conditions, turn away from anger.
If both sentient and non-sentient beings cause harm to living creatures, why single out and blame only those with minds? Therefore, be patient with harm.
Some commit faults due to ignorance. Some become angry due to ignorance. Who can be faultless in this? Who is the one with faults?
Why did I previously perform actions that harm others? If everything depends on karma, why should I be angry at this?
Having seen this, I will strive diligently to accumulate merit, so that all beings may develop mutual loving-kindness towards each other.
If a person condemned to death escapes by having their hand cut off, isn't that good? If one can be freed from hell through human suffering, isn't that good?
If I cannot endure even this much present suffering, why then do I not turn away from anger, the cause of hellish suffering?
Though I have experienced thousands of torments in hell, such as burning for the sake of desires, I have accomplished neither my own purpose nor the purpose of others.
This is not so harmful, and great purposes will be accomplished. Therefore, it is right to take joy here solely in removing the harm and suffering of beings.
If others praise someone's virtues and obtain joy and happiness, why don't you, O mind, also praise them and rejoice in the same way?
This joy and happiness of yours is a source of bliss without fault. It is approved by those endowed with good qualities. It is also supreme in attracting others.
Furthermore, if you do not desire this happiness, because you have abandoned giving rewards and so on, both the seen and unseen will deteriorate.
When speaking of one's own qualities, one wishes happiness for others. When speaking of others' qualities, one does not wish happiness for oneself.
Since all beings desire happiness, having generated the mind for enlightenment, if beings themselves find happiness, why then would one become angry?
If beings desire to attain enlightenment, honored in the three worlds, why do they become distressed upon seeing even a small act of service?
If he obtains it from that, or if the patron stays at home, if you don't have it at all, what does it matter whether it's given or not?
Why abandon merit, faith, or one's own good qualities? Tell me, who does not get angry at losing what they have gained?
Even if an enemy is displeased, what is there for you to be pleased about? Your mere ill wishes will not become a cause of harm to them.
Your desires bring suffering. Even if fulfilled, what joy is there for you? If you become satisfied, what could be more ruinous than that?
The hook cast by the fisherman of afflictions is unbearable. Caught by it, even in the vessel of the hell of the mind, the guardians of hell torment me.
Praise and fame do not increase merit, nor do they greatly change anything. They do not increase one's strength, do not prevent illness, nor do they make the body comfortable.
If I understand my own benefit, what self-interest is there in that? If one desires only mental happiness, one must also rely on ornaments and alcohol.
If one loses wealth for the sake of fame and even kills oneself, what use are mere words? Who finds pleasure in such flesh?
When a sand castle collapses, children become distraught. Similarly, when praise and fame diminish, one's mind becomes like a child's.
"For now, since sound has no mind, it's impossible for it to have thoughts of praising me. The notion that ""others are pleased with me"" is perhaps a cause for joy."
Whether it's for others or for myself, how does others' happiness benefit me? That joy and happiness is theirs alone; I gain no share from it.
If I am happy when others are happy, then I should strive for everyone's happiness. How is it that when others become happy through joy, I am not happy?
"Therefore, when I say ""I am praised,"" and feel joy arising in myself, even that is not reasonable, and is nothing but childish behavior."
Praise and such distract me. This destroys weariness. Jealousy towards those with good qualities and destroys prosperity.
Therefore, those who are near to destroy my praise and such, are they not engaged to protect me from falling into lower realms?
I who seek liberation do not need the bonds of gain and honor. How can I be angry at those who free me from my bondage?
I desire to enter into suffering. As if blessed by the Buddha, it has become an unopened door. How can I be angry at that?
This is said to be an obstacle to merit. Even so, it is not right to be angry at that. If there is no austerity equal to patience, Do I not abide in that?
If I do not practice patience with my own faults, I will only be obstructing myself from the source of merit that is close at hand.
That which does not arise without something, and which exists when that something exists, if that is its cause, how can it be called an obstacle to it?
The beggar who comes at the right time has not obstructed giving. One who causes renunciation should not be called an obstacle to ordination.
In the world, begging is common, but those who harm are rare. If one does not harm others first, no one will harm them.
Therefore, like a treasure appearing in my home without any effort, I should rejoice in my enemy, for he has become an ally in my practice of enlightened conduct.
Therefore, the fruit of patience should first be tested on this, as this is the cause of patience.
If you say this enemy should not be honored because there is no intention to cultivate patience, then why honor even the sublime Dharma, which is a cause for accomplishment?
If you say this enemy who intends to harm should not be honored, how can my patience be accomplished if I strive to benefit them like a doctor?
Therefore, since patience arises in dependence on intense anger, that very anger is the cause of patience. Thus, it is worthy of veneration like the holy Dharma.
From sentient beings and the victorious ones, the Buddha's qualities are equally accomplished. If we show respect to the victorious ones, why not show the same to sentient beings?
The qualities of intention are not one's own. They are from the result, and similarly, sentient beings also have qualities. Therefore, they are equal.
Whatever offerings are made to those with loving minds, that is the greatness of sentient beings. Whatever merit comes from faith in the Buddha, that too is the greatness of the Buddha.
Those who have the qualities of the Buddha's teachings are considered equal. However, none can equal the Buddhas with their boundless ocean of qualities.
Even if only a fraction of the supreme qualities appear in someone, offering the three realms as worship to them would still be insufficient.
Furthermore, to those who have become unwavering friends and who bestow immeasurable benefits, how else can one repay them except by pleasing sentient beings?
Since one who gives their body enters the Avici hell, and by benefiting them one repays their kindness, even if these beings cause great harm, one should practice only what is good for all of them.
Even my master, who has become my lord, does not regard his own body. How then can I, a foolish one, be arrogant and not act as a servant to him?
Those whose happiness pleases the sages, and those whose harm displeases them - by making them happy, all sages are pleased; by harming them, harm is done to the sages.
Just as a body engulfed in flames cannot be pleased by any desires, likewise, when sentient beings are harmed, there is no way for those of great compassion to be pleased.
Therefore, as I have harmed sentient beings, displeasing all the great compassionate ones, I confess each of those misdeeds today. I beseech the sages to be patient with whatever displeases them.
To please the Tathagatas, from this day forward I will be a servant to the world. Even if many beings trample on my head, or kill me, I will not retaliate. May the Protector of the World be pleased.
There is no doubt that the compassionate one has made all these beings his own. Seeing these beings in their true nature, why do I not revere that protector myself?
For example, although some of the king's men harm many people, those with farsightedness, even though they are capable, do not retaliate.
This is not the only case. The power of the king is his strength. Likewise, even a weak harmful being should not be killed indiscriminately.
Thus, like the guardians of hell and those endowed with compassion are their army. In this way, like the common people pacifying a fierce king, one should please all sentient beings.
When reborn, through patience one attains beauty and such, freedom from illness, and fame. One lives for a very long time, and obtains the expanding bliss of a universal monarch.
Cultivating diligence as just described, In this way, enlightenment abides in diligence. Just as there is no movement without wind, Merit does not arise without diligence.
Diligence is joy in virtue. Its opposite aspects will be explained: laziness, attachment to evil, discouragement, and self-contempt.
Because of tasting the pleasure of laziness and desire for sleep, one does not tire of the sufferings of samsara. Thus, laziness arises.
Have you not seen how your own side is gradually being killed? Yet those who rely on sleep are like outcasts and buffaloes.
With all paths blocked and the Lord of Death watching, how can you enjoy eating and how can you sleep contentedly like this?
Since death will come swiftly, accumulate merit for as long as possible. Even if laziness is abandoned then, what can be done when the time has not yet come?
"When this is left undone and that half-finished, Suddenly the Lord of Death will come, And I will think, ""Alas! I am undone!"""
With eyes swollen from intense grief, tears stream down reddened faces. Relatives lose all hope, and gaze upon the face of the messenger of death.
When tormented by remembering one's own sins, and hearing the sounds of hell, frightened and defiled in body, what can one do when intoxicated?
If you are fearful in this life, like a live fish writhing on the ground, what need is there to speak of the unbearable sufferings of hell that result from evil deeds?
When touched by hot water, it is extremely hot for those with tender skin. Having created the karma for hell, why do you remain so comfortable like this?
Those who desire results without effort, and the fickle-minded suffer much harm. Though appearing godlike, they are seized by death. Alas! They are destroyed by sufferings.
Relying on the boat of human birth, cross over the great river of suffering. This boat is hard to find later, so foolish ones, do not sleep when the time has come.
Having abandoned the supreme joy of the holy Dharma, which is the source of limitless joy, why do you delight in distractions and frivolity, which are causes of suffering?
Without laziness, with a group of supporters, take up diligence, control yourself, equalize yourself with others, and exchange yourself with others.
"One should not be discouraged, thinking, ""How can I attain enlightenment?"" For the Thus-Gone One, who speaks the truth, has spoken this truth."
Born as a human with the capacity for self-reflection, and knowing the difference between benefit and harm, if I do not abandon the practice of enlightenment, why would I not attain enlightenment?
If I fear that I must give up my limbs and such, without weighing what is heavy and what is light, I am merely afraid due to my ignorance.
For countless eons, being cut many times, pierced, burned, and torn apart, one will not attain enlightenment.
The suffering I experience in striving for enlightenment is limited. It is like the pain of incising the body to remove an internal ailment.
The supreme physician does not perform such ordinary treatments. With extremely gentle methods, he cures countless great illnesses.
Even in giving vegetables and such, the guide first engages in practice. Having become accustomed to that, later on, gradually one gives even one's own flesh.
When one develops the view of one's own body as like vegetables and such, what difficulty is there then in giving away flesh and so forth?
There is no suffering for the sake of abandoning evil. There is no unhappiness for the sake of wisdom. Thus, wrong views and evil harm the mind and body.
Through merit, the body is at ease. Through wisdom, the mind is at peace. Even while remaining in samsara for the benefit of others, why should the compassionate ones become weary?
This, by the power of bodhicitta, exhausts previous negative actions and accumulates an ocean of merit. Therefore, it is taught to be supreme, surpassing the hearers.
To accomplish the welfare of sentient beings, the forces are faith, steadfastness, joy, and renunciation. Faith is generated by contemplating suffering, fear, and the benefits of that.
Thus, abandoning opposing factors, one should strive to increase diligence through devotion, pride, joy, and renunciation, taking up mastery and power.
The faults of myself and others are immeasurable; I must strive to overcome them. Even for a single fault, it may take oceans of eons to exhaust.
When not even a fraction of the effort to exhaust negativities is seen in me, why does my heart not break, as I am a source of immeasurable suffering?
I have not worshipped the Blessed One, nor given the bliss of great festivals. I have not worked for the doctrine, nor fulfilled the wishes of the poor.
If I do not give fearlessness to the fearful and happiness to the miserable, I will only produce the pain and suffering of a mother's womb.
In the past and even now, due to my lack of devotion to the Dharma, I have experienced such poverty. Who would abandon devotion to the Dharma?
The Buddha taught that faith is the root of all virtuous qualities. The root of that faith is constantly meditating on the ripening effects of karma.
Suffering, unhappiness, various kinds of fears, and separation from desires arise from engaging in sinful actions.
By doing virtuous deeds with mindful intention, wherever one may go, there, by that merit, one will be honored with the fruits of virtue.
Though one desires happiness while committing evil, wherever one goes, that evil will thoroughly destroy one with the weapon of suffering.
The servants of the Lord of Death completely skin the body, causing extreme suffering. Molten copper melted by intensely hot fire is poured over the body. Flaming swords and short spears pierce the flesh, cutting it into hundreds of pieces. Falling onto an extremely hot iron ground, many evil deeds result in these torments.
Therefore, one should be inclined towards virtue and meditate with respect. Through the ritual of the vajra victory banner, one should begin to meditate on pride.
First, examine your resources. Then decide whether to undertake the task or not. Not undertaking is best, but once begun, do not turn back.
This world, powerless under afflictions, cannot accomplish its own purpose. Beings cannot do as I can, therefore I shall do this.
When encountering a dead snake, even a crow acts like a garuda. If one is weak, even a small mistake can cause harm.
Can one escape from poverty by giving up effort with discouragement? Even great ones find it difficult to succeed through efforts born of pride.
Therefore, with a steadfast mind, one should conquer downfalls. If I am defeated by downfalls, the desire to conquer the three realms will become a laughing stock.
I shall conquer all and let none conquer me. I, a child of the victorious lions, shall abide in this pride.
Those beings overcome by pride are not afflicted by pride. The proud do not fall under the power of enemies. Those with pride fall under the power of the enemy of pride.
The foolish, ugly, and weak are despised everywhere. Those filled with pride and practicing austerities, if they too are included among the proud, speak of how lowly they are.
The one who holds pride to conquer the enemy of pride, that is the proud one and the victorious hero himself. The one who definitely defeats even the challenge of the enemy of pride, accomplishes the fruit of victory as desired for beings.
When dwelling amidst afflictions, be patient in a thousand ways. Like a lion among foxes and such, remain unaffected by the throng of afflictions.
Thus, at all times, one should not engage in anything other than what is reasonable. Like desiring the pleasant results of play, what is the purpose of this action?
One should be attached to that work; one should delight in that work without being satisfied. Although work is done for the sake of happiness, it is uncertain whether happiness will result or not.
How can one be happy not doing what brings happiness? If one is not satisfied by desires, which are like honey on the edge of a razor blade,
Like an elephant entering a lake when it encounters one, one should engage in that task. If strength is diminished and consequences follow, one should abandon it for the sake of doing it again later.
If grasped well, it is for the future, and for the sake of future desires, that should be abandoned. Like facing an old enemy together on the battlefield, one should avoid the weapons of afflictions and strive to defeat the enemies of afflictions.
Just as one quickly picks up a sword that has fallen in battle out of fear, likewise, if the weapon of mindfulness is lost, swiftly recall the fear of hell.
Like one carrying a vessel filled with oil, with someone holding a sword sitting nearby, fearing death if it spills, so should the disciplined practitioner be vigilant.
"For each fault that occurs, I will reproach myself and think for a long time, ""How can I ensure this does not happen to me again?"" That is how I will act."
Just as in these circumstances, mindfulness becomes habitual. For this reason, one should desire to encounter or engage in reasonable actions.
Before undertaking any action, be mindful and remember the words of caution. Then rise up lightly with self-control.
Just as the wind controls cotton by its coming and going, likewise one is controlled by joy. In this way, accomplishment will occur.
Thus, having generated diligence, one should place the mind in concentration. Those whose minds are distracted dwell in the midst of afflictions.
Through seclusion of body and mind, distractions do not arise. Therefore, abandon worldly affairs and completely discard conceptual thoughts.
Those who crave are plagued far more than those engaged upon the path, Yet Buddhahood is not what they attain! Therefore, abandoning these entirely, the wise should examine it in this way.
Knowing that special insight endowed with calm abiding thoroughly destroys afflictions, first seek calm abiding. It is achieved through disenchantment with worldly attachments.
Who is impermanent yet becomes truly attached to the impermanent? They will not see their beloved for thousands of lifetimes.
If not seen, one does not become happy. The mind also does not become settled. Even when seen, one does not become satisfied. As before, one becomes tormented by craving.
If one becomes attached to sentient beings, it completely obscures the truth. It destroys the mind of renunciation, and ultimately leads to sorrow and anguish.
By merely thinking about these things, this life will pass meaninglessly. Through impermanent friends and companions, even the eternal Dharma will be destroyed.
If you associate with fools on equal terms, you will surely go to a bad rebirth. If you lead them without being on equal terms, what's the use of relying on fools?
In an instant, one can become a friend, and in a moment, turn into an enemy. Because they get angry at things that bring joy, ordinary beings are difficult to please.
When spoken to beneficially, they become angry. I too turn away from benefit. If their words are not heeded, through anger they will go to lower realms.
Jealousy and competition towards those above, pride and arrogance towards those below. When praised, one becomes haughty. When criticized, one becomes angry. When will benefit be obtained from childish behavior?
When associating with childish people, self-praise, criticism of others, and talk of delighting in samsara and such will certainly arise as non-virtuous actions.
Thus, relying on self and others only leads to ruin. They have not accomplished my purpose, and I have not accomplished theirs.
Stay far away from childish people. When meeting them, be cordial and pleased. Do not become too familiar with them. It is best to maintain an ordinary relationship.
"If I hold such pride, thinking ""I have many possessions and honors, many people like me,"" fear will arise after death."
Therefore, the wise should not be attached. From attachment, fear is born. As these things are naturally discarded, be steadfast and fully realize.
Though many gains may come, and fame and renown may arise, with all these accumulations of gain and fame, there is no certainty where one will go.
If others criticize me, why should I be pleased by praise? If others praise me, why should I be displeased by criticism?
When even the Victorious Ones cannot please beings of various dispositions, what need is there to mention someone like me, who is inferior? Therefore, abandon worldly thoughts.
They disparage beings who have nothing, speak ill of those who have possessions. How can joy arise from those who are naturally difficult to associate with?
Dwelling in a cave, in the upper part of a temple, or at the foot of a tree, may I never look back and become free from attachment.
When will I dwell in places unclaimed as one's own, in naturally vast spaces, free to roam without attachment?
Going to the charnel ground, when will my body and the skulls of others be equalized as things subject to destruction?
This very body of mine will become such that even jackals will not approach it due to its odor.
Even this single body that has arisen, with its flesh and bones born together, will disintegrate and separate. What need is there to mention other friends?
When born, one is born alone; when dying, one dies alone. If one does not take on the suffering of others, what use are obstructing friends?
Just as those who have entered the right path hold onto their abodes, likewise those who have entered the path of existence fully grasp their place of birth.
As long as four men have not lifted it from there, while the world grieves, go to the forest.
Without friends or enemies, this body dwells alone. Considering oneself as already dead, even when death comes, there is no sorrow.
Those who are in his presence are free from sorrow and harm. Therefore, no one will be distracted from recollecting the Buddha and so forth.
Abandoning all other thoughts, with single-minded focus on oneself, one should strive to stabilize and tame the mind.
In this world and the next, desires bring ruin. Here, they lead to killing, binding, and cutting. In the next world, they lead to hell and such.
For whose sake did the messenger and messenger woman previously make many requests, and for whose benefit did they not hesitate even in sinful or disreputable acts?
I have entered into fear, and my possessions have been exhausted. Those whom I fully embrace become supremely joyful.
If it is only a skeleton and nothing else, why not, desiring and clinging to freedom and selflessness, pass beyond sorrow?
Whoever first strives and lifts up, though led, looks down in shame. Whether seen before or not, the face is covered with cloth.
Your afflicted face, now clearly visible, has been seen stripped bare by vultures. Why do you now flee?
Though others look with their eyes, that which is completely protected, as long as it is consumed by that, why do you, the miser, not protect it?
Seeing this heap of flesh, if vultures and others eat it, adorn the food of others with garlands of flowers and sandalwood ornaments.
Seeing just a skeleton, you become frightened even though it doesn't move. If someone were to move like a zombie, why wouldn't you be terrified?
If feces and saliva come from the same single food, why do you dislike feces but like saliva?
"Not delighting in pillows soft as cotton to the touch, the lustful one is deluded about the impure, saying ""It does not leak foul odors."""
The foolish lustful ones, even when touching soft cotton, become angry saying they cannot have sexual intercourse with it.
If you have no attachment to impurity, why do you embrace in your arms this cage of bones tied together with sinews, smeared with the mud of flesh?
You yourself have much impurity, and you constantly use that. You also desire other sacks of impurity with greed for the impure.
"If you say ""I like this flesh"" and wish to touch and look at it, how can you desire flesh, which is by nature mindless?"
The mind of desire cannot be touched or seen. What can be touched is not consciousness. What is the use of meaningless embracing?
It is not so surprising that one does not realize the impure nature of others' bodies. What is truly astonishing is that one does not realize one's own body is impure.
Abandoning the young lotus opened by the cloudless sun's rays, why delight in impure traps with a mind attached to impurity?
If you don't want to touch a place defiled by impurities, how can you desire to touch the body from which they came?
If you have no attachment to impurity, why do you embrace in your arms another who is born from an impure field and produced by its seed?
From impurity comes impure worms. Even small ones you do not desire. Yet the body, which is by nature full of impurities, you desire even though it is born of impurity.
If you still doubt such impurity even when it's evident, go look at other impure bodies discarded in charnel grounds.
Though knowing that when the skin is peeled away, Great fear will arise, How is it that one still Repeatedly takes delight in it?
The fragrance applied to the body is only that of sandalwood and such, nothing else. Why should one be attached to others due to the scent of others?
If it is naturally foul-smelling, isn't it better not to be attached to it? Why would those who burn the world uselessly apply fragrance to it?
But what has happened to the fragrant sandalwood on this body? Why does one become attached to others due to the scent of others?
If long hair and nails, gray teeth with odor, and a body smeared with the smell of mud are the natural state, then the naked body itself is frightening.
Why do you polish and clean that which is like a weapon harming yourself? Through foolish efforts towards oneself, the madman disturbs this entire world.
When seeing only bones, you feel revulsion in the charnel ground. Yet do you delight in the village charnel ground, filled with moving skeletons?
Thus, that which has become impure cannot be obtained without a price. By striving to achieve its purpose, one becomes exhausted and experiences harm such as hell and so forth.
Children cannot increase wealth. When you reach adulthood, what happiness is this? If you spend your life accumulating wealth, what can you do with desires when you are old?
Some wicked, lustful people, exhausted from a long day's work, return home and lie down with their tired bodies like corpses.
Some who travel far, afflicted with troubles and suffering from long journeys, though desiring to see their children and wives, may not see them even in their dreams.
Those who wish to benefit me, though confused, even sell themselves for that purpose. Without achieving that goal, they are driven by the winds of others' actions in vain.
Some sell their own bodies, and are helplessly used by others. Even wives, when they have children, frequently go to the foot of trees in solitary places.
"Fools deceived by desire, saying ""We want to live, we will live,"" enter battle despite fearing for their lives, and become servants for the sake of profit."
Some lustful ones had their bodies cut. Some were impaled on stakes. Some were stabbed with short spears. Some were seen being burned.
Through the torment of accumulating, guarding, and losing, know that wealth is an endless source of trouble. Those distracted by attachment to wealth have no chance of liberation from the sufferings of existence.
For those with desires, there are many faults and little benefit, like oxen pulling a cart eating only a few mouthfuls of grass.
For the sake of trivial things that even animals can achieve without difficulty, this precious human life of leisure and opportunity, so hard to find, is destroyed by those tormented by their karma.
Desires will surely be destroyed and cause one to fall into hell and such places. Because it is not great, at all times there is exhausting effort.
If Buddhahood can be achieved with just a fraction of that effort, those who desire enlightenment but engage in greater suffering will not attain enlightenment.
When considering the sufferings of hell and such, weapons, poison, fire, precipices, and enemies cannot even serve as examples for the desires.
Thus, becoming weary of desires, cultivate joy in solitude. In the peaceful forests, empty of conflict and afflictions,
In empty houses, at the foot of trees, or in caves, dwell as long as you wish. Free from the suffering of clinging and protecting possessions, live carefree without dependence.
One who is free, unattached, and unconnected to anything, content and living happily - even for a powerful person, this is difficult to attain.
Through these and other such means, contemplate the qualities of solitude. Then, pacifying discursive thoughts, meditate on the mind of enlightenment.
From the very beginning, strive to meditate on the equality of self and others. Since happiness and suffering are equal, protect all as you would yourself.
Though there are many divisions such as hands and so on, they are one in being a body to be protected. Likewise, different beings' pleasures and pains are all equal in wanting happiness like oneself.
Even if my suffering does not harm others' bodies, still I cannot bear that suffering due to clinging to a self.
I should remove others' suffering, for it is suffering just like my own. I should benefit others, for they are sentient beings just like my own body.
When both myself and others equally desire happiness, what difference is there between us? Why do I strive for happiness for myself alone?
When both myself and others are similar in not wanting suffering, what difference is there between us? Why do I protect myself and not others?
If suffering does not harm me, why protect against it? And if future suffering does not harm, why guard against that?
"The thought ""I experience that"" is mistaken. For instance, the one who dies is different, and the one who is born is also different."
If it is said that even though it is not logical, one engages in self-grasping here, whatever is unreasonable, whether self or other, should be abandoned as much as possible.
Suffering has no owner; all are without distinction. Because it is suffering, it should be dispelled. What is to be done with certainty about that?
Why should the suffering of all be dispelled? This is beyond dispute. If it is to be dispelled, then all should be dispelled. If not, I am just like other sentient beings.
Why deliberately cultivate compassion that brings much suffering? When you consider the suffering of beings, how can compassion not bring much suffering?
If by one suffering, many sufferings can be eliminated, then one with compassion should generate that suffering for oneself and others.
Therefore, although Chandraprabha knew of the king's harm, he did not remove his own suffering, for the sake of eliminating the suffering of many.
Therefore, even when doing good for others, there is no pride or wonder. Solely delighting in benefiting others, there is no expectation of karmic fruits.
Therefore, just as one protects oneself from even the slightest unpleasantness, one should cultivate a mind of protection and compassion towards others in the same way.
"Through habituation, even though drops of semen and blood of others have no inherent existence, one knows them as ""self"", just like that."
"Likewise, why not consider another's body as ""self""? It is not difficult to regard one's own body as belonging to others."
Knowing oneself as flawed and others as oceans of qualities, one should meditate on completely abandoning self-grasping and embracing others.
Just as hands and so forth are considered parts of the body, why are embodied beings not considered parts of the world?
"Just as the notion of ""I"" arises in relation to this selfless body through habituation, why shouldn't the notion of ""I"" arise in relation to other sentient beings through habituation as well?"
Therefore, Lord Avalokiteshvara, with great compassion, to dispel the fears of beings' samsara, blessed even his own name.
Do not turn back from difficulties. Through the power of familiarity, Even that whose mere name brings fear, When absent, becomes a source of displeasure.
Whoever wishes to quickly protect oneself and others should practice the supreme secret of exchanging self and others.
Who would not hate this body like an enemy, which causes fear to arise even from small frightening things, due to attachment to one's own body?
What wise person desires this body, protects it, and honors it? Who does not view it as an enemy and despise it?
"If I give, what will I use? - thinking of one's own benefit is the way of demons. ""If I use, what will I give?"" - thinking of others' benefit is the way of gods."
If one harms others for one's own sake, one will suffer in hell and so forth. If one harms oneself for the sake of others, one will attain all perfections.
Those who desire to elevate themselves will become evil, wicked, and foolish. If one transfers that same [desire] to others, they will attain a good rebirth and respect.
Whatever happiness there is in the world, all of it comes from desiring others to be happy. Whatever suffering there is in the world, all of it comes from desiring oneself to be happy.
What need is there to say more? Look at the difference between these two: The childish who work for their own ends, And the Sage who acts for the sake of others.
Let alone the next world, even in this life, servants who don't work and masters who don't give rewards will not achieve their goals.
Abandoning all happiness and prosperity, both seen and unseen, the ignorant take on unbearable suffering due to causing suffering to others.
Whatever harm and fears there are in the world, and all the sufferings that exist, all arise from clinging to a self. What then can this great demon do to me?
"Mind, you must firmly understand: ""I am under others' control."" From now on, think of nothing else except the welfare of all beings."
It is not proper for the eyes and other senses, which are dependent on others, to accomplish their own purpose. Therefore, it is not right for the eyes and other senses to act contrary to that purpose.
Therefore, prioritize sentient beings. Whatever you see in your own body, take that and use it to benefit others.
By considering oneself inferior and others superior, and with a mind free from conceptual thoughts, one should meditate on jealousy, competition, and pride.
This one is honored, I am not. This one I have not found. This one is praised, I am criticized. This one is happy, I am suffering.
I perform actions, while this one remains in happiness. This one is great in the world, while I am known to be lowly and without qualities.
What use is there without qualities? I myself am endowed with all qualities. There are those who are inferior to this, and there are those who are superior to me.
Moral discipline, views, and such are not under one's control due to the power of afflictions. I must heal myself as much as possible, and I should willingly accept harm.
But I am not the one to be cured here. Why do you despise me? What use are their qualities to me? I am the one with qualities.
Those who dwell in the jaws of evil destinies, Without compassion for beings, Outwardly boast of their qualities, Wishing to challenge the wise.
Looking at those equal to oneself, in order to surpass them, one will certainly strive through dispute to secure one's own gain and honor.
My faults should be concealed. I am not to be honored here. Today I have gained well, but I am not to be respected here.
